# Long Practice: Class Syntax with Employees and Managers

Now that you've learned about class syntax, commonJs modules, and reading 
test specs, it's time to bring these skills together!

In this practice, you will:
1. Create and use JavaScript ES6 classes
2. Use inheritance to create a child of a parent class
3. Use polymorphism to overwrite/override an inherited method
4. Use commonJS modules to import/export your code

## Learning Goals

* Understand how a child class inherits from a parent class
* Know when and how to use `super` and `extends`
* Know how to override a parent class's method

## Introduction

HR has tasked you with building a simple application to keep track of each 
employees' `name`, `title`, `salary`, and `manager`. You will also need to
keep track of each manager's `name`, `title`, `salary`, their own `manager` 
(if they have one), as well as a list of each of employee they manage directly.

You will then need to calculate an employee/manager's individual yearly bonus, 
taking into account whether they are an employee or a manager.

## Project Overview

This project will leverage basic Class syntax to create an `Employee` class. 
In a separate file you will create a `Manager` class that will inherit its 
properties from the `Employee` class. 

Using common JSmodules to import/export your classes will allow you to keep your
code clean and maintainable.  

Once you know you can create both an instance of an employee and a manager, you
will alter your `Employee` constructor to dynamically add an `Employee` to 
their `Manager`'s `employees` list upon instantiation.

Finding an `Employee`'s bonus should prove pretty easy, but in order to 
calculate a `Manager`'s bonus you will need to use iteration and recursion
in order to find and sum the salaries of each `Employee` under that `Manager`.
If an `Employee` is also a `Manager` you'll need to sum their `Employee`s' 
salaries as well.

You will use a combination of local testing and test specs to ensure your 
application performs as it should.

## Set up

Clone the starter from the **Download** link at the bottom of this page.

Run ```npm install``` to install any dependencies.

## Phases

* Basic Phase 1: Define an `Employee` class 
* Basic Phase 2: Define a `Manager` class that extends the `Employee` class
* Intermediate Phase 3: Dynamically add `Employee`s to a `Manager`'s employee
array
* Advanced Phase 4: Calculate Bonuses
* Bonus Phase 5: Local Testing
