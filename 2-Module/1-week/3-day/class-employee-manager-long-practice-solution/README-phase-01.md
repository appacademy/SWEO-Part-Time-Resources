# Phase 1: Define the `Employee` class

HR has tasked you with building a simple application to keep track of each of 
the company's `Employee`s and `Manager`s.

## Instructions

Be sure that you are in the root of your project directory and create a new 
file named __employee.js__.

In the __employee.js__ file, use the class keyword to define an `Employee` 
class with a constructor method that sets an `Employee`'s `name`, `salary`, 
`title`, and `manager` properties. Make sure the `manager` property will be set
to `null` if no manager argument is passed in.

Export your `Employee` class. Use the test specs to help guide you by running:
```
npm test test/01-create-employee-spec.js
```

Outside of your class definition you can set up some local testing to see what 
your `Employee` class looks like.

```js
const leo = new Employee('Leonardo', 90000, 'Ninja');
console.log(leo)
```


When you place the snippet above in your code and run `node employee.js` in 
your terminal you should see something like this:

```bash
Employee {
    name: 'Leonardo',
    salary: 90000,
    title: 'Ninja',
    manager: null
}
```

Notice that you didn't pass anything to the `manager` argument. You still need 
to create a `Manager` class.

Move on to Phase 2 when you're ready!
