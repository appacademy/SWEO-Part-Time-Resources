## Classes and OOP

What is `OOP`?

- `Object Oriented Programming` is a design pattern that helps to break down large, complex problems into simpler pieces.
- The **main concept** behind `OOP` is the idea that you can group data and related actions together and treat them as a single entity within a larger system.
- The characteristics of an `object` are called `properties` or `attributes` of the object. (*keys and values that are just data*)
- The actions of the `object` are called `methods`. (*the object's functions*)
- Think of `properties` as an `object`'s 'Adjectives' and `methods` as the 'Verbs'.
- 4 Main Pillars
  - Encapsulation
  - Abstraction
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism (Tomorrow)

What is a `class`?

- A `class` is a blueprint for creating objects
- A instance of a `class` is an `object` with all the properties and methods defined
  on the `class`
- Some of our favorite datatypes such as `Array`, and `Object` are classes. For
  example the method `someArray.forEach()` is callable in this way because it is
  an instance method defined on the class `Array`.
  - [Array Constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Array)
  - Notice how we can create an array using the `new` keyword

Why does OOP use Classes?

- Classes are a clean way to `enclose` our data/behavior. (Encapsulation)
- They provide an API that hides the internal complexity(logic) and manages the data of our `object` (Abstraction)
- Classes allow us to model real world entities in an organized way

## Encapsulation + Abstraction

- `Encapsulation` means to put behavior and data together in a single unit.
- `Abstraction` means to hide internal implementation and show only the required features.
  - We dont need to know how it works, we just need to know how to use it.

## Project Time

- Make sure you ask questions if you get stuck!
- Every phase has its own section in open, but they are all the same project. You only need to download it once.
