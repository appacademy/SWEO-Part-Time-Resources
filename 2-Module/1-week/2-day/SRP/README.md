# Practice: Single Responsibility Principle

In this practice, you will be refactoring code to follow the Single
Responsibility Principle.

## Set Up

Clone the practice from the [starter].

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

## Directions

Take a look at the `bakeAndSellPies` function in the __practice.js__ file. This
function passes all the specs if you run `npm test`, but the function is doing
too much. Refactor the function into multiple helper functions to follow the
Single-Responsibility Principle.

When you are sure that you have successfully refactored the code, run `npm test`
to see if the functions still return the correct information by making sure all
the test specs still pass.
