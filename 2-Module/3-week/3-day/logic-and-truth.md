# Key Logic and Truth Points:

- ! = not
- && = both conditions are true
- || = one or both conditions are true
- XOR ( ^ ) = exclusive or, one is true, but not both

- True can be represented by 1, and false by 0.

- De Morgan's Law:
  !(A && B) === !A || !B


A | B XOR
-----
T | T  => F
T | F  => T
F | T  => T
F | F  => F
