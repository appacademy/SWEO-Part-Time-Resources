# Array practice

Identify the time complexity of each of these functions with a 1 sentence
justification for your answer. Assume `arr` is an array of length _n_.

## `arr.push()`

Time complexity: O(1)
Space complexity: O(1)
Justification: Adding to the end of an array requires no shifting and happens in
place.

[push on MDN][push]


## `arr.pop()`

Time complexity: O(1)
Space complexity: O(1)
Justification: Removing from the end of an array requires no shifting and
happens in place.

[pop on MDN][pop]

## `arr.shift()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
Justification: Removing from the front of the array requires all other values to
shift to the left by 1. This happens in place.

[shift on MDN][shift]

## `arr.unshift()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
Justification: Adding to the front of the array requires all other values to
shift to the right by 1 to make space for the first value. This happens in
place.

[unshift on MDN][unshift]

## `arr.splice()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
Justification: Splice will add or remove elements to the middle of the array
in-place. This requires shifting all elements to the right of the new location.

[splice on MDN][splice]

## `arr.slice()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)
Justification: This will create a new copy of the array with some elements
sliced out. The remaining _n_ values will need to be copied to the new location.

[slice on MDN][slice]

## `arr.indexOf()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
Justification: This will search visit each item in the array until it finds the
value. No extra space is needed.

[indexOf on MDN][indexOf]

## `arr.map()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)
Justification: Map creates a new array (O(n) space) with some function mapped to
each element. This is assuming the time complexity of the map callback has a
time complexity of O(1).

[map on MDN][map]

## `arr.filter()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)
Justification: Filter creates a new array (O(n) space) with a filter applied to
each element. This is assuming the time complexity of the filter callback has a
time complexity of O(1).

[filter on MDN][filter]

## `arr.reduce()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
Justification: Reduce applies a reducer function to each element in the array.
This is assuming the time complexity of the accumulator has a time complexity of
O(1).

[reduce on MDN][reduce]

## `arr.reverse()`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
Justification: Reverse will move all n elements in-place.

[reverse on MDN][reverse]

## `[...arr]`

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(n)
Justification: The spread operator will copy all n elements in the original
array to a new array of length n.
