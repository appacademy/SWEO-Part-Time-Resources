#### Only two kinds of things are truly stored in memory
  - Instructions
  - Raw data









## Pointers, references, etc
- What do 16/32/64-bit even mean?
  - 0000000000
  - 1111111111
- How much space is needed to store an address/reference/pointer on a 16/32/64-bit system?
- What is a variable?
- What is an array?
- What is a stack?
  - Like an array, but...
  - Things can only be added to or removed from the top
- Let's "zoom out" on Node
