# Practice Dynamic Arrays

Your task is to implement the constructor, `read` and `unshift` function on a Dynamic Array.

You may use brackets to access values in your data like `data[i]` but no other built-in
JavaScript array methods. You cannot use [unshift][mdn-unshift] to implement your `unshift`.

## Instructions

1. Clone the [starter] repo
2. Install all packages by typing `npm install`
3. Read through the test specs to understand the task
4. Run specs with `npm test`
5. Implement the DynamicArray constructor, `read` and `unshift` methods until
   tests are green
