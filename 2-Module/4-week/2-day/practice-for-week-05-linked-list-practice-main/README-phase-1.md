# Practice Linked Lists Phase 1 - Singly Linked List

In this phase, your task is to implement the constructor, `addToHead` and
`addToTail` functions for a singly linked list.

## Directions

Start by implementing the most basic linked list that can `addToHead` and
`addToTail`. It should only have a `head` pointer, no `tail` pointer.

Read the test specs in **test/linked-list-practice-specs.js** for details.

Add your code to **linked-list.js**.

Run tests with `npm test test/linked-list-practice-specs.js`

Read test specs for implementation requirements and details.
