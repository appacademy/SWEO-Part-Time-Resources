# Practice Linked Lists Phase 2 - Doubly Linked List

In this phase, your task is to implement the constructor, `addToHead` and
`addToTail` functions for a doubly linked list.

Continue working in same the [starter] repo as phase 1.

## Directions

Next, implement the same `addToHead` and `addToTail` functions in a doubly
linked list. It should have both a `head` and `tail` pointer.

Add your code to **doubly-linked-list.js**.

Run tests with `npm test test/doubly-linked-list-practice-specs.js`

Read test specs for implementation requirements and details.
