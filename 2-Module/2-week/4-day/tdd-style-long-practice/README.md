# Long Practice: Test-Driven Development

Now it is time to start writing some tests! For this next practice, you'll be
using test-driven development (TDD). A TDD approach dictates that you'll follow
the TDD workflow, meaning that you'll need to follow the TDD workflow of
**Red**, **Green**, **Refactor**.

## Background and Context

![tdd-cycle][rgr]

The three steps for approaching all of the below problems will be to:

1. **Red**: Write the tests and watch them fail (a failing test is red).
2. **Green**: Write the minimum amount of code to ensure the test passes.
3. **Refactor**: Refactor the code you just wrote to make it readable and
   maintainable.

You can assume for the rest of the practice that you will be using Mocha as your
testing framework and Chai as your assertion library.

Be sure to utilize the available documentation for this practice:

- [Mocha][mocha],
- [Chai][chai]
- [Chai Spies][chai-spies]

The tests you are writing today will be good practice for the _rest of your
programming career_ so take your time and ensure you are writing the best tests
you can!

## Phase 0: Set up

Clone the starter from the **Download** link at the bottom of this page.

Run `npm install` to install any dependencies.

Follow the directions to complete each phase:
- Phase 1: Testing the `reverseString` function
- Phase 2: Testing multiple functions
- Phase 3: Testing the `myMap` function
- Phase 4: Testing a class
- Phase 5: Testing multiple classes
