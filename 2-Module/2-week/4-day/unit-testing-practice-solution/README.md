# Practice: Unit Testing with Mocha and Chai

In this practice, you will create unit tests with the `mocha` testing library
and the `chai` assertion library.

## Set up

Clone the starter from the **Download** link at the bottom of this page.

Run `npm install` to download dependencies.

## Instructions

1. In the file **funcs.js**, you will find three skeleton functions. Your job is
   to complete those functions according to the specs found in
   **test/funcs-spec.js**.
2. In the file **class.js**, you will find a class `Word`. Your job is to write
   the test code in **test/class-spec.js** to test the constructor, its
   variables, and the instance methods found in the `Word` class.

Run `npm test` to confirm your code is written correctly.
