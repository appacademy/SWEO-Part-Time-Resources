# Finding the largest value node at each level

Your objective is to find the node with the highest value at each level of a
binary tree.  Note, this is a binary tree, but it is **not** a binary search
tree.  This isn't a factor for this problem, but nodes will not be organized
with smaller on the left and large on the right.

1. Clone the assessment repository from the starter.
2. `npm install` to install any dependencies
3. Fill out code in `tree_practice.js`
4. Uncomment the marked code and run `node tree_practice.js` to run local test
   cases
5. `npm test` to run the test specs

## Submission

When you are ready to submit:

1. Delete the `node_modules` directory
2. Zip up your folder
3. Upload it
