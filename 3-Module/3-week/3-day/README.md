## Demo: HTTP Server Creation, Parsing Req Body, and Routes

---

## Practice: HTTP Basics Long Practice

This practice is focusing on documenting an API.

You are given a functional server to test.

You will be adding your guesses to the readme and then testing the route using Postman to check to see if you were right or wrong.

### Example

#### Ask for a page that doesn't exist

1. Fill in these sections
2. Test a route that doesn't exist
3. Think about why you were right/wrong
4. If needed edit your guesses

Request components:

- Method: GET
- URL: /any-route-that-doesnt-exist
- Headers: none
- Body: none

Response components:

- Status code: 404
- Headers:
  - Content-Type: text/html
- Body: "Page Not Found" HTML Page
