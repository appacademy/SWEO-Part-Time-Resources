    <h1>Web Design Principles Demo</h1>
    <p>
      As a designer, I’ve always believed that whitespace is THE fundamental
      building block of good design. When designers talk about whitespace, they
      actually mean negative space, the space between elements in a composition.
      It is the portion of the page left unmarked; the space between graphics,
      margins and gutters. It is the space between columns, between lines of
      type or figures that provides visual breathing room for the eye.
    </p>

      Whitespace is an important element of design for good reason. If used well
      and correctly, it can transform a design and provide many advantages to
      your website. We need to deliver and develop layouts that are easy on the
      eyes and make people want to keep reading. It’s always important to
      remember that when we are designing for the web, our number one goal is to
      deliver a great product to our clients.

    <h2>The Advantages of Using Whitespace</h2>

          <strong>Increased Content Legibility:</strong> When users are on your
          site, they should be able to see where they are going and be given a
          reason to keep reading. Believe it or not, whitespace between
          paragraphs and around blocks of text and images actually helps people
          understand what they are reading and adds up to a better user
          experience overall.

          <strong>Ability to Highlight Call to Actions (CTAs):</strong> At
          times, the most obvious way to make something stand out is to make
          things bigger. You can make images bigger or buttons bigger. However,
          surrounding the item with whitespace can be just as effective.

          <strong>Creating Balance:</strong> oo little whitespace leads to
          confusion, disorganization and unreliability – qualities you don’t
          want associated with your site’s brand. On the other hand, too much
          whitespace could highlight a lack of content and a lack of user
          guidance. The key is to balance your designs and let whitespace act as
          a great tool to separate chunks of content for easy accessibility and
          improved user experience.
