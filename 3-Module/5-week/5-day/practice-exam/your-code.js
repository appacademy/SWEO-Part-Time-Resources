// Select the second square using class names. Change the background color to
// orange, the text color white, and the border to 5px dashed black.

// Your code here


// Problem 3
// Select all of the squares that have a class of "plus", and double their
// width. Increase the size of the font as well. 
// HINT: Check the CSS file or use your Dev Tools to find the original width and
// font-size, and then double those sizes.

// Your code here

// Problem 4
// Select the fourth box. Give it an id of "problem-four". Remove the class of
// "square" and add a class "round". As a result, the item should turn a
// different color and shape due to code in the css file.

// Your code here

// Problem 5
// Use JavaScript to remove boxes 5, 6, and 7. Can you remove multiple boxes at
// once? Think about what element selectors you could use? How could you
// manipulate attributes so that you could remove them all at once? What other
// approaches can you think of?
// NOTE: There are many possible approaches to this. Try 2-3 approaches and
// evaluate which one achieves the goal in the best way.
