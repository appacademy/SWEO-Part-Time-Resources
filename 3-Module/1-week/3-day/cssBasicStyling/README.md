# CSS Basic Styling Practice

In this practice you will be using CSS to style the HTML provided.

## Set up

Clone the practice from the [starter].

## Background and Context

Your main focus is to practice using different CSS stylings to familiarize
yourself with the vast typography, sizing, text styling and use of background
images that CSS has to offer.

## Phase 1: CSS Styles

Once you have downloaded the starter, open the __index.html__ file in your
browser.

Then navigate to the __main.css__ file and start experimenting with the
different CSS stylings. You can change the text in multiple aspects. Start
changing the styles and save and refresh your page to see the changes.

Try styling this story as a blog entry with proper margins and gutters on the
left and right sides of the text. Import a webfont that looks nice with the
text and headings.

## Phase 2: Background Image

After you have styled your text you will notice a div with the class of logo.
In this phase insert the App Academy logo into the CSS background-image url.
From there you can set the background color of the image and the height and
width to your liking. Once saved you will see the App Academy logo at the bottom
of your page.
