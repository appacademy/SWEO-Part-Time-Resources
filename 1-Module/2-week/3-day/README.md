# Helper Functions

###### We heard you like functions so we've put some functions in your functions so you can call a function while you call a function

---

Sometimes a problem is easy to solve in a single function

Other times, solving a problem in a single function is **_doable_**, but it's not necessarily **_feasible_**.

`Helper functions` are functions we write to help us solve a more complex problem

- ### Remove E Words

```js
// Removes all words from the sentence with the letter "e"
let removeEWords = function (sentence) {};
```

- ### Echo

```js
// Returns a string "echo-ized"
let echo = function (string) {};
```
