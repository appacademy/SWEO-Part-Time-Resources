# Scope Project

It's time to get some practice using scope in the wild! This task includes a
link to clone a GitHub repo with a number of problems.

Complete the problems in the order specified. In addition to the prompts
available at the top of each file, Mocha specs are provided to test your work.

To get started, use the following commands:

1. `cd` into the root project directory (if needed)
2. `npm install` to install any dependencies
3. `npm test` to run the test cases
