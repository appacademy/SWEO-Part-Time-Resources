# Debugging A Stack Overflow

Uh oh! We've written a recursive function, but it's throwing an error! 
Investigate the included problem and see if you can figure out what's going on.

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
Once you think you've fixed the issue, use `mocha` to confirm. Make sure
you're in the project's root. Once there, run the following command:

```sh
> mocha
```

If you get stuck, step back and try breaking the problem down. Are we missing 
any key steps for a recursive function?

When the tests pass and the error is gone, take a minute to celebrate - you're 
officially a recursion debugger!
