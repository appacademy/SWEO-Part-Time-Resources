# Timeout Project

Time to practice dealing with asynchronous functions like `setTimeout` and 
`setInterval`. Your objective is to implement the functions in each file
of the `/problems` directory. In addition to the prompts available at the 
top of each file, Mocha specs are provided to test your work.

To get started, use the following commands:

1. `cd` into the project directory
2. `npm install` to install any dependencies
3. `mocha` to run the test cases
