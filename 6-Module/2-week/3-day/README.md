Make sure to call us into your breakout room during practice time if you are at all confused with what you are working on!

## Warm Up

```js
// You are given a 2-D array of nums. Find the subarray with the highest sum and return that sum. 
// The main block of code is written out for you. Try to refactor it to incorporate a helper function.

function findSum(arr) {

};

function highestSum(arr) {

};

console.log(highestSum([[1,2,3], [3,5], [2,5]]))  // 8
console.log(highestSum([[2,6,7], [1,5,6], [4,5]])) // 15
```
