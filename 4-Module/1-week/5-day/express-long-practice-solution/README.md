In this project, you will be connecting boilerplate middleware to your Express
application and creating your own middleware.

`cd` into the `server` folder.

`npm install` the dependencies.

Run `npm run dev` to start the server at [http://localhost:5000] in
development.

[http://localhost:5000]: http://localhost:5000

## Phases

Here is the list of all the phases in this practice:

1. Boilerplate Express Middleware (Basic)

2. Creating Express Middleware (Basic)
   - create Express middleware and connect them to an Express application
3. API Resource Routers (Basic)
