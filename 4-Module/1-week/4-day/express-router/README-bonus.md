# Bonus Practice: Express Router

**This is additional practice for today's material which you are not expected to
complete today. Complete as much of this practice as you can. You can use any
problems you didn't complete as optional additional practice for the
assessment.**

## Expand your Express router

Add the following endpoints to the router for the `colors` resource:

- `POST /colors/:name/css-styles` - send a JSON of `"POST /colors/:name/css-styles"`
- `DELETE /colors/:name/css-styles/:style` - send a JSON of `"DELETE /colors/:name/css-styles/:style"`

Refer to the `people` router if you get stuck.

Test the endpoints using Postman, the browser, or the console in the browser.
