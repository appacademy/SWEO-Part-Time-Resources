# BONUS Practice: Serving Static Files in Express

In this practice, you will serve more static files inside the folder of an
Express application.

## File paths appended to a resource II

Serve the files in the `assets/images` folder under a route resource called
`stickers`.

What do you expect the URL path to be for requesting the
`assets/images/hello.png` file? Is your hypothesis correct?
