# Kanban Project Board Cards

The following cards will guide the implementation of the AirBnB API. Each
section should be copied into it's own card on the Kanban project board.
Each feature's progress should be tracked by checking off requirements as they
are met and progressing the cards from the `Backlog`, `Next Tasks`,
`In Progress`, `In Review`, and `Accepted` columns.


## Kanban Cards

Copy each of the following sections into its own card on a Kanban board for the

to be copied directly:
