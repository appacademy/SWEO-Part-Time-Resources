# Basic Phase 5: SELECT Clauses

In this phase, you will create queries using different SELECT clauses.

Write your SQL queries in `sql-practice/phase-5.sql` file. You can run the file
by executing it in the terminal:

```shell
sqlite3 practice.db ".read phase-5.sql"
```

try doing it in multiple and then refactor to just one query.

What do you expect as the output of the SQL query? Does your query results
match what you expected?
