# BONUS Exercise: SQL Database Tables Visualizer

In this exercise, you will continue using an online tool to create a diagram for
a small set of SQL database tables.

## Continue exploring with the previous schema

Take the remaining time to add more tables and drag the
tables around in the diagram to make it look nice.

Here are a few suggestions to get your started. Please come up with more or
different tables on your own!

* Occupations
* Timezones
* Posts (e.g. a social media post)
* Comments (e.g. the electronic equivalent of a comment card)

Be creative! As you work, discover what questions you have, so you can bring
them to your instructions during your next discussion.

> Tip: Write down questions as you have them while you are problem-solving. If
> you get a solution, you can cross them off your list of ones to ask, and
> perhaps you'll find that others had the same or similar questions too!
