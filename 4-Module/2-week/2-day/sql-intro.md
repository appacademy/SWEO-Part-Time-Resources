## RDMS - Relational Database Management System

- Program that allows you to create, update, and administer a relational
  database
- Can contain any number of databases
- Examples: PostgreSQL & Sqlite3

## Database

- collection of interrelated tables with relevant data for a given application
  or service

## Table

- Made up of a specific set of columns which specify the type of data, and rows
  which hold the actual data (each row is called a record)
- Every row is a single instance of data, containing a value for every column

## SQL - Structured Query Language

- Language used to construct tables
- There are many tools that make writing SQL easier for us
  - We will learn one, Sequelize, next week!

## PostgreSQL

- What you will use when hosting your projects
- The database on your computer is not accessible by your pair
  - Each person will have their own database on their own computer

## Sqlite3

- What you will use for everything else
- The database is actually just a file in your project folder
- Can be pushed to github, so pairs can pick up from where you left off

## Key Notes To Keep In Mind

- This is another concept heavy mod("effort mod") and also "look-up" heavy week
  - Does it make sense why we do something when we do it?
  - Are we comfortable finding the syntax for how to do something?
  - Heavily lean on your readings to guide you
- Practice makes perfect, Bonus Practice makes a passing exam score
