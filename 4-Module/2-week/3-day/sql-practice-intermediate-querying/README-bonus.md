# Practice: Intermediate `SELECT`ing of Data

Now, it's time to practice more advanced `SELECT` queries in SQL.

## Getting started

Using the same database as the original practice, implement the following
queries.

## INTERMEDIATE Query 1: `SELECT` for attributes matching a pattern

Run the SQL command that returns the albums with titles that start with `'The'`.

## INTERMEDIATE Query 2: `SELECT` ordered data

Run the SQL command that returns the albums that have the two highest sales
numbers.

## ADVANCED Query 3: `SELECT` in the middle of ordered data

Run the SQL command that returns the *next* two highest sales numbers (only
the third and fourth highest sales).
